    "rating": 5,
    "text": "Ever since I saw Mr Miyagi in the Karate Kid meticulously pruning his Bonsai tree with a pair of toenail clippers I've wanted one of these cute little trees. When it arrived I was immediately impressed. It looked just like the picture here on Amazon. Well packaged & healthy. Many months later its still going strong. It even grew enough so that I had the opportunity to break out the toenail clippers & have some fun. If you're into that sort of thing, this is a great little tree. If not it makes a great gift. Either way I think you'll be happy."

    "text": "I was one of the unfortunates to receive a \"twiggy\" way out of shape, weed. The cost with shipping wasn't worth it. With that said, I'm going to attach a photo, give it a year and re-attach the \"New and improved\" Bonsai. I love challenges and it's going to be a huge challenge indeed. I was sent a juniper that in NO WAY could be close to a year old. NOT EVEN CLOSE to a three year old specimen, as advertised (false advertising!!!)"

    "text": "I received this bonsai as a gift. I was very wary at first, because I have killed numerous bonsai in the past, but this one was different. Well established, it thrived even when I forgot to water it for a few days. It has a healthy growth, a nice planter which comes with it, and a decorative rock. I would definately recommend this bonsai for those who really want to try a bonsai but haven't had much luck in the past!"

    "rating": 1,
    "text": "This wreath arrived today. It is not 20 inch-measured it- it is 15. But the real problem is the smell. It is not a natural Balsam smell, it is a spray on scent smell. I am not allergic to trees (have a fresh Balsam Christmas tree in my living room) but this smell is unnatural, powerful, and immediately affected my breathing. There is nothing natural about the smell and had I been forewarned, I would never have ordered this."
